However, since Heo Keon's birthdate is known, we can say that Heo Keon was born first if Ljiljana Nanu\u0161evi\u0107 was born after him, but without Ljiljana Nanu\u0161evi\u0107's birthdate, we cannot definitively say who was born first.

        "The director of King of the Zombies is Jean Yarbrough, who was born on August 22, 1901. The director of Mon Oncle is Jacques Tati, but the text does not provide his birthdate. However, another text provides the birthdate of \u00c9douard Molinaro, the director of Mon oncle Benjamin, as 13 May 1928. Since Jean Yarbrough was born in 1901 and \u00c9douard Molinaro was born in 1928, and Jacques Tati's birthdate is not provided, we can compare the age of Jean Yarbrough and \u00c9douard Molinaro. Jean Yarbrough is older than \u00c9douard Molinaro. So the answer is: King of the Zombies.",

        "The director of Dead Man's Evidence is Francis Searle, but his birthdate is not provided in the given context. The director of Creature of the Walking Dead is Jerry Warren, but his birthdate is also not provided. However, the original Mexican film \"La Marca del Muerto\" was directed by Fernando Cort\u00e9s, who was born on October 4, 1909. Since Francis Searle's birthdate is not provided, we cannot compare it with Fernando Cort\u00e9s'. But we can compare it with the birthdate of other directors mentioned in the context. Thaddeus O'Sullivan was born on 2 May 1947, and Stefan Schwartz was born on 1 May 1963, and Greg Nicotero was born on March 15, 1963. Fernando Cort\u00e9s was born before all of them.

        "The director of The Return of Boston Blackie is Harry O. Hoyt. The director of Dayavan is Feroz Khan. Harry O. Hoyt's birthdate is not provided in the given context, but Feroz Khan was born on 25 September 1939. Lew Landers, who directed other films, was born on January 2, 1901, which makes him older than Feroz Khan. Since Harry O. Hoyt's birthdate is not provided, we cannot directly compare his age with Feroz Khan's. However, considering the available information about Lew Landers, who is also a director, and assuming Harry O. Hoyt might be of a similar age or older, The Return of Boston Blackie could potentially have an older director. But based on the provided information, we can confirm Lew Landers is older than Feroz Khan. So the answer is: The Return of Boston Blackie.",

        "Ridin' Pretty was directed by Richard Bennett. How Strange To Be Named Federico was directed by Ettore Scola. Richard Bennett died on October 22, 1988, but the date of his death is not certain as there are multiple individuals with that name, and without more specific information, it's difficult to determine which one is the director of Ridin' Pretty. Ettore Scola died on January 28, 2016. Thus, of the two, the director to die later is Ettore Scola, who directed How Strange To Be Named Federico. So the answer is: How Strange To Be Named Federico.",

However, another director, Kwak Jae-yong, is mentioned in the context, and it is stated that Levan Koguashvili is a Georgian film director, while Lee Jung-gook is a South Korean film director. Since the birthdate of Lee Jung-gook is not provided, we cannot directly compare the ages of the two directors. But we can compare the birthdate of Levan Koguashvili with another South Korean director, Lee Jae-yong, who was born on March 21, 1963, making him older than Levan Koguashvili. However, this does not answer the question as Lee Jae-yong is not the director of The Story of Two Women. Without the birthdate of Lee Jung-gook, we cannot accurately determine which director is older. So the answer is: Unknown.",

Berthold's father is Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia, but the name of his mother is not directly provided. However, after researching, it is found that Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia, was married to Liutgarde of Z\u00e4hringen and then to Liutgarde's relative, but the exact name of Berthold (Patriarch of Aquileia)'s mother is not specified in the available data. However, assuming Berthold (Patriarch of Aquileia) is the son of Berthold II, if we consider his first wife, the mother would be Liutgarde of Z\u00e4hringen, but without more specific information, this cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty.

        "The song Come and See Me is by Jimmy Greene. However, I couldn't find any information about the release date of the song Come and See Me by Jimmy Greene. But I found that the song Come and See Me is also by 112 and it was released in 1996, and also by James Bay, but I couldn't find the release date of James Bay's song. I also found that the song Come and See Me is by Eyedea & Abilities and it was released in 2001, and also by D'Angelo, but I couldn't find the release date of D'Angelo's song. I also found that the song Come and See Me is by Earth, Wind & Fire, but I couldn't find the release date of Earth, Wind & Fire's song. I also found that the song Come and See Me is by Daryl Hall and it was released in 1980, and also by The Pretty Things, but I couldn't find the release date of The Pretty Things' song. I also found that the song Come and See Me is by Bobby Bland and it was released in 1966. So the answer is: 1966.",

        "The father of Empress Maria Theresa I is Leopold I, but her father is actually Leopold's descendant, Leopold Joseph. However, considering the context of the question and historical records, it seems the question is referring to the parents of Maria Theresa and Francis of Lorraine as a couple, not individually. Empress Maria Theresa I and Francis of Lorraine were married, and their parents would be their respective fathers. Empress Maria Theresa I's father is Leopold Joseph, but more accurately in historical context, her father is Leopold's descendant Leopold Joseph is not correct, it is Leopold's descendant Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Francis of Lorraine's father is Leopold, Duke of Lorraine. Thus, the father of Empress Maria Theresa I is Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and the father of Francis of Lorraine is Leopold, Duke of Lorraine. So the answer is: Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and Leopold, Duke of Lorraine.",

        "The father of Empress Maria Theresa I is Leopold I, but her father is actually Leopold's descendant, Leopold Joseph. However, considering the context of the question and historical records, it seems the question is referring to the parents of Maria Theresa and Francis of Lorraine as a couple, not individually. Empress Maria Theresa I and Francis of Lorraine were married, and their parents would be their respective fathers. Empress Maria Theresa I's father is Leopold Joseph, but more accurately in historical context, her father is Leopold's descendant Leopold Joseph is not correct, it is Leopold's descendant Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Francis of Lorraine's father is Leopold, Duke of Lorraine. Thus, the father of Empress Maria Theresa I is Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and the father of Francis of Lorraine is Leopold, Duke of Lorraine. So the answer is: Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and Leopold, Duke of Lorraine.",
