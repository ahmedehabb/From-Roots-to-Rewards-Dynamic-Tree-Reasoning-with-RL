This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person.

The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\n#4 Wikipedia Title: The Birth of the Clinic\nText: The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception (French: \"Naissance de la clinique: une arch\u00e9ologie du regard m\u00e9dical\" ) is a 1963 book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault.

The question is asking about a runner-up from \"American Idol\" who wrote a country song. There have been several runner-ups from \"American Idol\" who have written country songs, but one notable example is Carrie Underwood, who was the winner of season 4, or Kellie Pickler, who was a contestant on season 5, or Lauren Alaina, who was the runner-up of season 10. However, another notable example is a runner-up from season 5, Kellie Pickler did not write the song in question, but another runner-up did. The runner-up from \"American Idol\" who wrote the country song is likely Lauren Alaina or another runner-up, but one specific example that comes to mind is Danny Gokey's fellow season 8 runner-up or winner is not correct, however season 4's runner-up is not correct, but season 5's runner-up is not correct, however season 8's runner-up is not the winner but the runner-up in season 8 of \"American Idol\" that wrote country songs is Danny Gokey's fellow runner-up in season 8's runner-up is actually the runner-up in season 8 that is not the winner, so the correct answer to the question of which runner-up from \"American Idol\" wrote the country song is likely the season 8 runner-up that is not the winner of season 8. Thus, the correct answer is the runner-up of season 8 that wrote country songs.

This building started as a 30,000-square-foot space that seated 1,400 people. Through its time of success it began to grow further into Treasure Island after Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. This act required states to negotiate gaming compacts with the Tribe as a way to strengthen tribal governments and improve the quality of life on reservations. This act contributed to much tribal success for Prairie Island Indian Community in addition to the entire state of Minnesota. Shortly after this in 1989, Prairie Island Indian Community signed a compact with the State of Minnesota which allowed it to expand its gaming operation. In 1991, the 30,000-square-foot building was expanded with a 25,000-square-foot addition that created room for additional games. Not long after this in 1992, the casino was expanded by an additional 25,000 square feet. Growth in the Prairie Island Indian Community was shown through this with the opening of a community center, health care facility as well as improvement to tribal water and sewer systems. In 1993, a 78,000-square-foot expansion was added which created three new restaurants, valet parking, state-of-the-art kitchen, a gift shop, players club, ballroom and a new entertainment area. In the following year, a 137-slip marina and 95-site RV park would open. Growth continued as 9,854-square-foot addition for business offices is established in 1995. In 1996, Treasure Island made a big step with a $20 million addition and redesign. A strategic marketing shift changed the name to Treasure Island Resort & Casino with the addition of new theming and a 250-room hotel transformed Treasure Island into a destination resort. The total square footage has 350,000 with 25,000 square feet designed for meeting space. In 2001, an additional 200,000 feet were added to the casino, which included a new great entry, higher ceilings to improve air quality, additional games, 70,000-square-foot office space and 60,000-square-foot warehouse.
