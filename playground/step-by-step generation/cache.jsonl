{"input": ["\n        You are helping to decompose a complex question into smaller reasoning steps. Here is the current state of the tree:\n        - Current Node: The main question that needs to be broken down into smaller steps.\n        - Existing Children: A list of atomic subquestions (thoughts) already generated to help answer the main question.\n\n        ### Task:\n\n        1. **Carefully analyze the reasoning tree**:\n            - If the existing children fully address the current node and no further meaningful steps are needed, respond only with \"Done\"\n            - If the current node needs further decomposition, suggest a single new child node that directly contributes to solving the main question.\n\n        2. **Follow these rules for decomposition**:\n            - **Focus on essential steps**: Suggest only subquestions that directly contribute to resolving the current node. Avoid peripheral details unless they are crucial.\n            - **Avoid redundancy**: Do not repeat or rephrase existing children. Each new child node must add unique and meaningful information.\n            - **Simplify complexity**: Keep subquestions clear and actionable. Avoid unnecessary depth unless it is required to make progress.\n            - **Reference previous answers**: If a new child node depends on answers from previous children, use placeholders like `<1>`, `<2>`, etc., to reference them.
